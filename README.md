# covid-analysis

This project started as a way for me to practice my Python programming skills, and help me better understand terms such as 'flatten the curve' and 'infection rate', which have been common terms in assessing the pandemic.

Data is collected from a variety of sources, including: John Hopkin's CSSE database, county-level DoH dashboards, the U.S. census bureau, and FOIL requests. 

To manipulate this data, I've become more familiar with Python libraries such as pandas, numpy, along with folium and seaborn to visualize the data. 

'COVID Global Data.ipynb' and 'Comparative State COVID.ipynb' use John Hopkin's CSSE database from:
https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19 

'Comparative State..' does not contain NYC bororough specific data. See 'NYS API.ipynb'

'NYS API.ipynb' pulls county data from NYS Department of Health Open Database at:
